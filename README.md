### Overview

This dataset contains anonymized records of cancer diagnosis and the initiation of oncological treatment in Brazil, carried out through the public health system (SUS ‚Äì Sistema √önico de Sa√∫de) between 2013 and 2023. The data were compiled from the **Oncology Treatment Monitoring Panel (Painel-Oncologia)**, developed by Brazil‚Äôs Ministry of Health and processed by DATASUS.

The dataset is designed to monitor compliance with **Law No. 12.732/2012**, which mandates that patients diagnosed with malignant neoplasia begin treatment within 60 days of diagnosis.

### Dataset origin

It is worth noting that this dataset was uploaded as a `.csv` file. Due to this, it contains **only 20% of the original data** (which would be around 600‚ÄØMB in `.csv` format). The full dataset is available on [DataSUS](https://datasus.saude.gov.br/transferencia-de-arquivos) as compressed database files (in `.dbc` format).

The steps for decompressing and processing the original database are detailed in the Jupyter Notebook titled [How to Obtain Data from DataSUS](https://github.com/tenoriolms/dataset_PO_DataSUS/blob/main/How%20to%20obtain%20data%20from%20DataSUS.ipynb). If you are interested in working more extensively with this dataset, it is recommended to use the complete data.

Nevertheless, the 20% sample provided here is sufficient to gain insights into Brazil‚Äôs public oncology treatment system.

### Data Sources

The records are derived from several SUS health information systems:

- **SIA-SUS**: Outpatient Information System  
- **SIH-SUS**: Hospital Information System  
- **SISCAN**: Cancer Information System  

These systems are integrated and consolidated by DATASUS, forming a unified database on cancer diagnoses, treatment modalities, and timing between diagnosis and treatment.

---

### Time Period

- Diagnosis data: from **2013 to 2023**  
- Treatment data: available starting in **2013**, with more complete records from **May 2018** onward, when the registration of CNS and ICD-10 codes became mandatory.

### Potential Uses

- Analyze treatment delays and time-to-treatment after cancer diagnosis.
- Map regional disparities in access to cancer care across Brazil.
- Study epidemiological patterns by sex, age, cancer type, and geography.
- Build predictive models to identify risk factors for delayed treatment.
- Support public health planning and cancer care policies.

---

### Important Notes

- The dataset includes only **SUS-registered patients with a valid National Health Card (CNS)**.
- Some variables may have missing data, especially before 2018.
- Negative intervals between diagnosis and treatment may occur in surgical cases where treatment preceded the formal diagnosis record.
